# Final-Project
I will be examining some statistical methodologies commonly used in the criminal justice system as well as their moral justification. With the guidance of the review article "Artificial Intelligence, Predictive Policing, and Risk Assessment for Law Enforcement" written by Richard A. Berk, a professor in the Department of Statistics and Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, I will discuss various statistical modeling techniques commonly used in predictive policing such as Bayesian approaches, Point Process models, and Support Vector Machines. To analyze how these methods may be transferred for real data, I will examine the Crime Data package in R from the Open Crime Database. In particular, I will be focusing on the crimes committed in Nashville, TN during the year of 2022, and specifically, the likelihood of a motor vehicle theft occurring within a 0.1 Euclidean distance of the recorded motor vehicle theft on December 29, 2022 at the coordinates (-86.76, 36.23). I will apply Bayes Theorem, Poisson Process, and Support Vector Machines with the hope of determining whether or not these methods provide consistent results and accuracy and whether these methods are morally justified.
